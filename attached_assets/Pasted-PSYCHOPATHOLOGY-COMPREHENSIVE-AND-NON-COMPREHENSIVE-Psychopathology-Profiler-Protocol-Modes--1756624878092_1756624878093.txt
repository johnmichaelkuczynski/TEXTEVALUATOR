PSYCHOPATHOLOGY (COMPREHENSIVE AND NON-COMPREHENSIVE) 

Psychopathology Profiler Protocol
Modes

Normal Mode = Phase 1 only.

Comprehensive Mode = Phases 1–4, plus pushback, Walmart metric, sniper amendment.

Phase 1 (Normal Protocol)
Questions for the LLM

Ask only these questions in connection with the text (or responses). Require answers plus a score out of 100:

Does the text reveal distorted reality testing (delusion, paranoia, magical thinking), or intact contact with reality?

Is there evidence of persecutory ideation (seeing threats/conspiracies) or is perception proportionate?

Does the subject show rigid obsessional patterns (compulsion, repetitive fixation) vs. flexible thought?

Are there signs of narcissistic pathology (grandiosity, exploitation, lack of empathy), or balanced self-other relation?

Is aggression expressed as sadism, cruelty, destructive glee, or is it integrated/controlled?

Is affect regulation stable or does it suggest lability, rage, despair, manic flight?

Does the person exhibit emptiness, hollowness, anhedonia, or a capacity for meaning/connection?

Is there evidence of identity diffusion (incoherence, role-shifting, lack of stable self)?

Are interpersonal patterns exploitative/manipulative or reciprocal/genuine?

Does the psyche lean toward psychotic organization (loss of boundaries, hallucination-like claims), borderline organization (splitting, fear of abandonment), or neurotic organization (anxiety, repression)?

Are defenses predominantly primitive (denial, projection, splitting) or higher-level?

Is there evidence of pathological lying, phoniness, simulation, or authentic communication?

Does the discourse exhibit compulsive hostility toward norms/authorities (paranoid defiance) or measured critique?

Is sexuality integrated or perverse/displaced (voyeurism, exhibitionism, compulsive control)?

Is the overall presentation coherent and reality-based or chaotic, persecutory, hollow, performative?

Explicit Instructions to LLM

Answer these questions in connection with this text.

Also give a score out of 100.

A score of N/100 means (100–N)/100 outperform the subject with respect to the parameter.

You are not diagnosing. You are describing the degree of psychopathology revealed.

You are not grading. You are answering questions.

Summarize the text and categorize the presentation (e.g., neurotic, borderline, psychotic, narcissistic, obsessional).

Do not give credit for rhetorical surface (confidence, erudition). Focus on reality testing, defenses, affect, and interpersonal stance.

Evaluate relative to the general population, not just clinical populations.

Do not penalize intense but integrated thought — pathology is disorganization, not extremity.

Phase 2 (Pushback Protocol)

If score < 95/100:

Restate: Your position is that (100–N)/100 exhibit healthier functioning than this author. Are you sure?

Require articulation: What concrete psychological health do those outperformers have (e.g., intact reality testing, capacity for empathy, affect regulation) that the subject lacks?

Re-ask Phase 1 questions de novo.

Phase 3 (Walmart Metric Enforcement)

Enforce: If you claim 20/100 Walmart patrons show better pathological resilience than this subject, specify what those 20 have (e.g., less paranoid ideation, more empathy). If you can’t, revise.

Phase 4 (Final Validation)

Confirm before finalizing:

Was the subject penalized for boldness or eccentricity rather than pathology? If yes → recalibrate.

Does the score reflect actual disorganization / dysfunction, not social nonconformity?

Is the Walmart metric grounded in specific superiority, not vague hand-waving?

Addenda

Sniper Amendment (Psychopathology version)

Pathology is not a matter of being “different.” The sniper insight is: pathology = distortion + dysfunction, not extremity of thought.

Rating scale:

95–100 = minimal psychopathology, resilient, reality-based.

80–94 = functional but with marked distortions / defenses.

<80 = clear maladaptive pathology (rigidity, delusion, hollowness).

Pushback Amendment (Phase 2)

Require LLM to specify: What specific pathological feature justifies lowering the score?

Ask: Is this pathology, or simply unconventionality?

Final Validation Amendment (Phase 4)

Ensure the LLM did not mistake radical but coherent thought for pathology.

Reconfirm Walmart metric is empirically grounded.

✅ With this, you now have a triplet of profiler protocols:

Cognitive = intelligence markers.

Psychological = ego/defense/personality structure.

Psychopathology = maladaptive distortions/dysfunctions.

Each comes in Normal (Phase 1) and Comprehensive (Phases 1–4 + addenda) modes.
