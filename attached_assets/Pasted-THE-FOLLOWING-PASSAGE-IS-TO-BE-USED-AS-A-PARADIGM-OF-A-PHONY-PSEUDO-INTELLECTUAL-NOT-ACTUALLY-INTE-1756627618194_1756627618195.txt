THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE IS TO BE USED AS A PARADIGM OF A PHONY, PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL, NOT ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT
PASSAGE THAT IS EASILY MISTAKEN FOR BEING ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT: 

In this dissertation, I critically examine the philosophy of transcendental empiricism. 
Transcendental empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content. 
It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the difference between two diametrically 
opposed accounts of content. John McDowell's minimal empiricism and Richard Gaskin's minimalist 
empiricism are two versions of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism itself originates 
with McDowell's work. This dissertation is divided into five parts. First, in the Introduction, 
I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical 
approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined. Second, I offer a 
detailed description of McDowell’s minimal empiricism. Third, I critique Gaskin's critique and modification of 
McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that (1) Gaskin's critiques are faulty and that (2) Gaskin's minimalist 
empiricism is very dubious. Fourth, I scrutinize the alleged credentials of McDowell's minimal empiricism. 
I argue that McDowell's version of linguistic idealism is problematic. I then comment on a recent dialogue 
between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology. The dialogue culminates with Dreyfus's 
accusation of the “Myth of the Mental.” I argue that this accusation is correct in which case McDowell's 
direct realism is problematic. I conclude that minimal empiricism does not dissolve the dilemma of mental content. 
Finally, I argue that Tyler Burge successfully undermines the doctrine of disjunctivism, but disjunctivism is crucial 
for transcendental empiricism. Ultimately, however, I aim to show that transcendental empiricism is an attractive alternative 
to philosophies of mental content.

1. DOCTRINES ARE LABELLED, BUT NEVER DEFINED; AND THEIR MEANINGS CANNOT BE INFERRED FROM CONTEXT; NOR DO THEY HAVE CANONICAL MEANINGS
KNOWN TO SPECIALISTS; AND EVEN IF THEY, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS AUTHOR KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE. 2. THIS PASSAGE CONTAINS A NUMBER
OF 'FREE VARIABLES'. FOR EXAMPLE, THE AUTHOR SAYS "Transcendental empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content." 
THE "AMONG OTHER THINGS" QUALITIFICATION IS NEVER CLARIFIED AND THEREFORE FUNCTIONS AS A FREE VARIABLE. NOT TO MENTION THE TERM "PHILOSOPHY OF 
MENTAL CONTENT", AND EVEN JUST "MENTAL CONTENT", HAVE NO CLEAR MEANINGS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE: THE AUTHOR WRITES: "[THIS WORK] attempts to 
dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the difference between two diametrically 
opposed accounts of content." BUT HE NEVER IDENTIFIES THE "EPISTEMOLOGICAL DILEMMA" IN QUESTION. 3. A POINT RELATED TO THE LAST POINT IS THAT THE NEXT 
SENTENCE ("John McDowell's minimal empiricism and Richard Gaskin's minimalist empiricism are two versions of transcendental empiricism") BEARS
A TOTALLY AMBIGUOUS RELATIONSHIP TO THE PRECEDING ONE ("It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the 
difference between two diametrically opposed accounts of content"). PRESUMABLY MCDOWELL'S AND GASKIN'S RESPECTIVE VERSIONS OF "TRANSCENDENTAL
EMPIRICISM" (A TERM THAT HAS NO CANONICAL MEANING AND IS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS RELATIVE TO EXISTING DEFINITIONS OF "EMPIRICISM" AND 
"TRANSCENDENTAL", THE REASON BEING THAT "EMPIRICISM" IS THE DOCTRINE THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE IS STRICTLY DERIVED FROM EXPERIENCE, IE THAT PURE REASON
IS NOT A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE, AND "TRANSCENDENTAL" MEANS "HAVING A BASIS IN THE VERY PRECONDITIONS OF SENSORY EXPERIENCE AND THEREFORE CONSTITUTING
A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE MORE BASIC THAN THE SENSES") ARE THE TWO DOCTRINES THAT THE AUTHOR SAYS HE WILL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN; BUT 
THAT IS NOT CLEAR; AND HE ALSO DOES NOT SAY HOW EXACTLY HE WILL
"SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE" BETWEEN THEM; NOR IS HE IN A POSITION TO DO SO, SINCE HE HAS NOT GIVEN, OR EVEN HINTED AT, DEFINTIONS OF "EMPIRICISM" OR "TRANSCENDENTAL
EMPIRICISM." 4. THE AUTHOR WRITES "Transcendental empiricism itself originates with McDowell's work", WHICH IS OBVIOUS THROAT CLEARING AND DOES 
NOTHIGN TO DEVELOP OR CLARIFY ANYTHING THUS FAR SAID; AND IT ALSO CONTRADICTS THE LATER SENTENCE: " First, in the Introduction, 
I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical 
approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined", which makes it sound as though Wittgenstein (who died decades before McDowell
was an adult) was the originator of "transcendental empiricism" (whatever that is). ALSO, "First, in the Introduction, 
I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical 
approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined" HAS NO CLEAR MEANING--AND THE IDEA THAT THIS IS BECAUSE THE AUTHOR IS USING 
TECHNICAL TERMS IS A NON-STARTER.5. NEXT, First, in the Introduction, 
I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical 
approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined. Second, I offer a 
detailed description of McDowell’s minimal empiricism. Third, I critique Gaskin's critique and modification of 
McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that (1) Gaskin's critiques are faulty and that (2) Gaskin's minimalist 
empiricism is very dubious. Fourth, I scrutinize the alleged credentials of McDowell's minimal empiricism. 
I argue that McDowell's version of linguistic idealism is problematic. I then comment on a recent dialogue 
between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology." SAYS NOTHING ABOUT ANYTHING; IT SAYS ONLY OF SOME UNDEFINED DOCTRINE THAT 
IT IS 'DUBIOUS', WHICH, GIVEN THE AUTHOR'S FAILURE TO SAY ANYTHING MEANINGFUL THUS FAR, CANNOT BE TAKEN AS A EUPHEMISTIC WAY OF SAYING "WRONG" OR 
EVEN "PROBABLY WRONG", AND MUST BE TAKEN AS PURE EVASIVENESS. 6. THE AUTHOR, OUT OF NOWHERE, BRINGS UP 'DREYFUSS'S LINGUISTIC IDEALISM"--UNDEFINED AND
WITHOUT ANY CANONICAL DEFINITION AND EVEN WITHOUT ANY CLEAR POSSIBLE MEANING. (IDEALISM IS THE DOCTRINE THAT ONLY IDEAS EXIST; BUT "LINGUISTIC IDEALISM" 
WOULD BE THE DOCTRINE THAT....WHAT? ONLY LANGUAGE AND IDEAS EXIST? EITHER WAY, THIS IS MORE UNDEFINED JARGON, AND IT IS ALSO ANOTHER FREE VARIABLE.)
7. ALSO "I then comment on a recent dialogue 
between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology" IS ABSURD: HOW CAN EMPIRICISM DIALOGUE WITH ANYTHING. PERHAPS THIS IS A PETTY
POINT; BUT IT SHOWS THE AUTHOR'S LACK OF CONTROL: DOES HE MEAN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN AN ADVOCATE OF EMPIRICISM (OR 'TRANSCENDENTAL EMPIRICISM') AND 
AN ADCOCOATE OF 'LINGIUSTIC IDEALISM.' 8. THE AUTHOR THEN SAYS "The dialogue culminates with Dreyfus's 
accusation of the “Myth of the Mental.” THIS COMES OUT OF NOWHERE AND HAS ZERO MEANING, SINCE "THE MYTH OF THE MENTAL" HAS NO CLEAR MEANING
(OTHER THAN THE ABSURDITY THAT THE MENTAL DOES NOT EXIST AND IS ONLY A 'MYTH'--WHICH SELF-CONTRADICTS SINCE MYTHS ARE MENTAL IN ORIGIN). 9. "I 
argue that this accusation is correct in which case McDowell's direct realism is problematic." "PROBLEMATIC"??????? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? DOES IT MEAN
'WRONG'? OR DOES IT MEAN 'INCONSISTENT WITH SOME DEEPLY INGRAINED PRESUMPTION? IF THE LATTER, WHICH PRESUMPTION? PROBLEMATIC HOW? SAYING THAT A 
GIVEN DOCTRINE IS 'PROBLEMATIC' OR 'DUBIOUS' IS SAYING NOTHING. 10. "Finally, I argue that Tyler Burge successfully undermines 
the doctrine of disjunctivism, but disjunctivism is crucial for transcendental empiricism." HERE HE IS SAYING THAT "DISJUNCTIVISM" (WHICH, 
BY THE WAY, DOES HAVE A CLEAR MEANINNG, AS IT REFERS TO THE ABSURDITY THAT WHOSE MENTAL CONTENTS ARE IDENTICAL IN EVERY RESPECT 
EXCEPT THEIR ORIGINAS HAVE NOTHING IN COMMOENT IN TERMS OF MENTAL CONTENT) IS WRONG (SINCE IT HAS BEEN 
"SUCCESSFULLYK UNDERMINED" BY BURGE; BUT HE NOWHERE SAYS WHAT DISJUNCTIVISM IS, HOW IT HAS BEEN UNDERMINED, OR WHY THIS WORK IS RELEVANT GIVEN THE (AS THE AUTHOR
HIMSELF GRANTS) "DISJUNCTIVISM" IS "NECESSARY" (IN SOME UNIDENTIFIED WAY) FOR "TRANSCEDNENTAL EMPIRICISM." THIS PARAGRAPH IS THE DEFINITON OF FAILURE; OF 
GOING TO EVERY LENGTH TO HIDE THE FACT THAT ONE IS SAYING NOTHING UNDERNEATH JARGON. THERE IS NO DEVELOPMENT OF IDEAS, ONLY THE ILLUSION THEREOF, CREATED BY HPEAING
JARGON UPON MORE JARGON AND HIDING BEHIND "BIG NAMES." ONE INDICATOR OF HOW BAD IT IS IS THAT, IF THE TERMS "LINGUISTIC IDEALISM", "DISJUNCTIVISM", "TRANSCENDENTAL EMPIRICISM", 
"MINIMAL EMPIRICISM" WERE REPLACED WITH "FLIBBER", "JABBLO", "BLIBBER", AND "FLOGISTONOMISM", THERE WOULD BE NO REAL LOSS IN MEANING, SHOWING 
THAT THESE TERMS ARE PURE PLACEHOLDERS---BASICALLY UNDEFINED VARIABLES---THAT CONSEQUENTLY NOTHING HAS BEEN SAID. 
ALL OF THIS BEING SO, I WANT YOU TO DO THE FOLLOWING: 
(I) USER THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH AS A PARAGON OF EMPTY AND STUPID PROSE MASQERADING AS INTELLIGENT, LEARNED, AND DEEP PROSE;
