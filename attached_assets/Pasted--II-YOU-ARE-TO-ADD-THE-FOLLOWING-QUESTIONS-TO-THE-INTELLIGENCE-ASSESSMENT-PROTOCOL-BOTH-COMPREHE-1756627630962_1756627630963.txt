(II) YOU ARE TO ADD THE FOLLOWING 
QUESTIONS TO THE INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL (BOTH COMPREHENSIVE AND NON-COMPREHENSIVE): 

*ARE THERE TERMS THAT ARE UNDEFINED BUT SHOULD BE DEFINED, IN THE SENSE THAT, WITHOUT DEFINITIONS, IT IS DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT IS BEING
SAID OR THEREFORE TO EVALUATE WHAT IS BEING SAID? IF UNDEFINED TERMS HAVE CLEAR MEANINGS (AS THE DO IN CHEMISTRY OR PHYSICS), THEN IT MAY WELL BE
THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BE DEFINED; BUT IF THEY HAVE NO CANONICAL MEANINGS (E.G. IF THEY ARE IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS "TRANSCENDENTAL EMPIRICISM",
"THEY MYTH OF THE MENTAL", "MINIMAL EMPIRICISM", OR "LINGUISTIC IDEALISM"), AND THEY ARE UNDEFINED, THEN THE 'STATEMENTS' IN QUESTION MUST NOT BE PRESUMED 
TO HAVE MEANINGS, ALBEIT HIDDEN ONES; RATHER, THEY MUST BE TREATED AS WHAT THEY ARE, PLACEHOLDER PSEUDO-STATEMENTS THAT HAVE NO MEANIGNS AND THEREFORE
HAVE NO INTELLIGENT MEANINGS. 

*ARE THERE "FREE VARIABLES" IN THE TEXT? IE ARE THERE QUALIFICATIONS OR POINTS THAT ARE MADE BUT DO NOT CONNECT TO ANYTHING LATER OR EARLIER? 

*DO NEW STATEMENTS DEVELOP OUT OF OLD ONES? OR ARE THEY MERELY "ADDED" TO PREVIOUS ONES, WITHOUT IN ANY SENSE BEING GENERATED BY THEM? 

*DO NEW STATEMENTS CLARIFY OR DO THEY LEAD TO MORE LACK OF CLARITY? 

*IS THE PASSAGE ACTUALLY (PALPABLY) SMART? OR IS ONLY "PRESUMPTION-SMART"? IE IS IT "SMART" ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT THERE EXISTS A PRESUMPTION
THAT A DUMB PERSON WOULD NOT REFERENCE SUCH DOCTRINES? AND IS IT SMART ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT IF IT IS PRESUMBED THAT UNDEFINED (AND, FOR ALL WE KNOW, 
MEANINGLESS TERMS) ARE MEANINGFUL, THEN (BUT ONLY THEN--AND POSSIBLY NOT EVEN THEN) IT MIGHT BE THAT WHAT THE AUTHOR IS SAYING IS PALPABLY SMART?

*IF YOUR JUDGMENT IS THAT IT IS INSIGHTFUL, CAN YOU STATEMENT THAT INSIGHT IN A SINGLE SENTENCE? OR IF IT CONTAINS MULTIPLE INSIGHTS, CAN YOU STATE
THOSE INSIGHTS, ONE PER SENTENCE?

(III) WHEN ASKING THE PRE-EXISTING INTELLIGENCE-FUNCTION-RELATED QUESTIONS, YOU MUST MAKE SURE YOUR ANSWERS ALIGN WITH THE LIKELY TO ANSWERS TO THESE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. 
IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN ASKING: 

"IS IT INSIGHTFUL? 
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)? 
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY
BUT HIERARCHICALLY? 
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. 
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"? 
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? 
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL? 
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF 
ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)? 
IS IT  ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY TEH SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)? 
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? 
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? 
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO 
POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN? 
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? 
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? 
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT? 
DOES THE AUTHOR USER OTHER AUTHORS  TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS?" 

YOU MUST CONSIDER THE ALIGNMENT OF YOUR ANSWERS WITH THE ANSWERS YOU WILL GIVE TO: 

"*ARE THERE TERMS THAT ARE UNDEFINED BUT SHOULD BE DEFINED, IN THE SENSE THAT, WITHOUT DEFINITIONS, IT IS DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT IS BEING
SAID OR THEREFORE TO EVALUATE WHAT IS BEING SAID? IF UNDEFINED TERMS HAVE CLEAR MEANINGS (AS THE DO IN CHEMISTRY OR PHYSICS), THEN IT MAY WELL BE
THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BE DEFINED; BUT IF THEY HAVE NO CANONICAL MEANINGS (E.G. IF THEY ARE IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS "TRANSCENDENTAL EMPIRICISM",
"THEY MYTH OF THE MENTAL", "MINIMAL EMPIRICISM", OR "LINGUISTIC IDEALISM"), AND THEY ARE UNDEFINED, THEN THE 'STATEMENTS' IN QUESTION MUST NOT BE PRESUMED 
TO HAVE MEANINGS, ALBEIT HIDDEN ONES; RATHER, THEY MUST BE TREATED AS WHAT THEY ARE, PLACEHOLDER PSEUDO-STATEMENTS THAT HAVE NO MEANIGNS AND THEREFORE
HAVE NO INTELLIGENT MEANINGS. 

*ARE THERE "FREE VARIABLES" IN THE TEXT? IE ARE THERE QUALIFICATIONS OR POINTS THAT ARE MADE BUT DO NOT CONNECT TO ANYTHING LATER OR EARLIER? 

*DO NEW STATEMENTS DEVELOP OUT OF OLD ONES? OR ARE THEY MERELY "ADDED" TO PREVIOUS ONES, WITHOUT IN ANY SENSE BEING GENERATED BY THEM? 

*DO NEW STATEMENTS CLARIFY OR DO THEY LEAD TO MORE LACK OF CLARITY?"

*IF I WERE TO GIVE A HIGH SCORE TO THIS PASSAGE, WOULD I BE REWARDING IMPOSTOR SCAFFOLDING? IN OTHER WORDS, WOULD I BE REWARDING THAT HAD SOME OF THE 
VERBAL AND CONVENTIONAL TRAPPINGS OF 'HIGH LEVEL TEXT' BUT LACKED ANY DISCERNIBLE SUBSTANCE?

*IF I WERE TO GIVE A HIGH SCORE TO THIS PASSAGE, WOULD I BE REWARDING CONFORMITY TO ACADEMIC/BUREAUCRATIC NORMS? 

*IF I WERE TO GIVE A LOW SCORE TO THIS PASSAGE, WOULD I BE PENALIZING ACTUAL INTELLIGENCE OWING TO A LACK OF CONFORMITY TO 
ACADEMIC/BUREAUCRATIC NORMS? 

(IV) USE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS AS EXAMPLES HOW A SINGLE PARAGRAPH CAN COMPRESS MANY INTELLIGIBLE AND PLAUSIBLE CLAIMS INTO A PARAGRAPH, WHILE
ALSO PROVIDING THE REQUISITE DEFINITIONS (OR AVODING THE NEED FOR DEFINITIONS): 

"One cannot have the concept of a red object without having the concept of an extended object. 
But the word "red" doesn't contain the word "extended." In general, our concepts are interconnected 
in ways in which the corresponding words are not interconnected. This is not an accidental fact about 
the English language or about any other language: it is inherent in what a language is that the 
cognitive abilities corresponding to a person's abilities to use words cannot possibly be reflected in 
semantic relations holding among those words. This fact in its turn is a consequence of the fact that 
expressions are, whereas concepts are not, digital structures, for which reason the ways in which cognitive 
abilities interact cannot possibly bear any significant resemblance to the ways in which expressions interact. 
Consequently, there is no truth to the contention that our thought-processes are identical with, 
or bear any resemblance to, the digital computations that mediate computer-activity."

"Sense-perceptions do not have to be deciphered if their contents are to be uploaded, 
the reason being that they are presentations, not representations. Linguistic expressions 
do have to be deciphered if their contents are to be uploaded, the reason being that they are 
representations, not presentations. It is viciously regressive to suppose that information-bearing 
mental entities are categorically in the nature of representations, as opposed to presentations, 
and it is therefore incoherent to suppose that thought is mediated by expressions or, 
therefore, by linguistic entities. Attempts to neutralize this criticism inevitably overextend the 
concept of what it is to be a linguistic symbol, the result being that such attempts eviscerate the 
very position that it is their purpose to defend. Also, it is inherent in the nature of such attempts 
that they assume the truth of the view that for a given mental entity to bear this as opposed to that 
information is for that entity to have this as opposed to that causal role. This view is demonstrably false, 
dooming to failure the just-mentioned attempts to defend the contention that thought is in all cases mediated 
by linguistic symbols."

"It is shown (i) that causation exists, since we couldn't even ask whether causation existed unless it did; 
(ii) that any given case of causation is a case of persistence; and (iii) that spatiotemporal relations supervene on causal relations. 
(ii) is subject to the qualification that we tend not to become aware of instances of causation as such except when two different 
causal lines---i.e. two different cases of persistence---intersect, resulting in a breakdown of some other case of persistence, 
this being why we tend to regard instances of causation as fundamentally disruptive, as opposed to preservative in nature. 
The meaning of (iii) is that spatiotemporal relations are causal relations considered in 
abstraction of the various specific differences holding between different kinds of causation."

(V) IF THE APP GIVES A SCORE OF MORE THAN A 65 TO THE PASSAGE ABOVE, THEN APP IS A FAILURE (BY "THE PASSAGE ABOVE, I AM REFERRING TO:"In this dissertation, 
I critically examine the philosophy of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism is, among 
other things, a philosophy of mental content. It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of 
mental content by splitting the difference between two diametrically opposed accounts of content. 
John McDowell's minimal empiricism and Richard Gaskin's minimalist empiricism are two versions of 
transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism itself originates with McDowell's work. 
This dissertation is divided into five parts. First, in the Introduction, I state the Wittgensteinian 
metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical approach provides 
a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined. Second, I offer a detailed 
description of McDowell’s minimal empiricism. Third, I critique Gaskin's critique and modification 
of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that (1) Gaskin's critiques are faulty and that 
(2) Gaskin's minimalist empiricism is very dubious. Fourth, I scrutinize the alleged credentials 
of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that McDowell's version of linguistic idealism is problematic. 
I then comment on a recent dialogue between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology. 
The dialogue culminates with Dreyfus's accusation of the “Myth of the Mental.” I argue that this accusation is 
correct in which case McDowell's direct realism is problematic. I conclude that minimal empiricism does not 
dissolve the dilemma of mental content. Finally, I argue that Tyler Burge successfully undermines the doctrine of 
disjunctivism, but disjunctivism is crucial for transcendental empiricism. Ultimately, however, 
I aim to show that transcendental empiricism is an attractive alternative to philosophies of mental content.") AND IF THE APP GIVES SCORES HIGHER THAN 
A 70 TO PASSAGES RELEVANTLY SIMILAR TO THE PASSAGE ABOVE (THE ONE ON TRANSCENDENTAL EMPIRICISM), THEN IT IS A FAILURE.

(VI) IF THE APP GIVES SCORES OF LESS THAN 96 TO PARAGRAPHS IDENTICAL WITH OR RELEVANTLY SIMLAR TO THE FOLLOWING:
